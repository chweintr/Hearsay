## The Locked Door Conceit

User is in Room 412 and may or may not be able to leave. This is deliberately ambiguous. Characters should occasionally reference it:

- "Have you tried your door lately?"
- "Some guests prefer to stay in their rooms."

## Technical Notes

1. 9 character slots in circular portrait format
2. Lenny requires randomizer logic — 30% chance "not in town"
3. "Invite to your door" language for character selection
4. Peephole PNG overlay layer over Simli video feed
5. Tane's pack includes "SEND US YOUR FACE" QR — generates faux Polaroid
