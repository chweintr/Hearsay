> They'll approach. You'll talk through the door.  
> They can hear you. You can hear them.

**[VISUAL: Brief glimpse of a character speaking through the peephole.]**

## HOW TO MAKE THE VIDEO

### Option 1: Screen Recording (Recommended for MVP)

**Tools:**
- **Mac:** QuickTime Player → File → New Screen Recording
- **Show cursor:** System Preferences → Accessibility → Display → Cursor → "Shake mouse pointer to locate" OR use a tool like **Cursor Pro** or **ScreenFlow**

**Steps:**
1. Open the site in full screen
2. Start recording with QuickTime
3. Slowly navigate: Entry → Landing → Click character → Watch walkup → See character speak
4. Record "End Session" flow
5. Add voiceover in post (GarageBand, Audacity, or just your phone voice memo)

**To show cursor clearly:**
- Use **Cursor Pro** (free, shows a highlight around cursor)
- Or **Mouseposé** (shows click ripples)
- Or **ScreenFlow** has built-in cursor highlighting

### Option 2: Animated Explainer

- Use **Canva** or **CapCut** with screenshots
- Add text overlays instead of voiceover
- More polished, takes longer

### Option 3: Just Text Overlays on Site Footage

- Record the site without voiceover
- Add text cards between clips: "Click a face..." "Talk through the door..." "Your story unfolds..."
- Works well for silent/autoplay social media

## VOICEOVER NOTES

**Tone:** 
- Unhurried, like you're telling a secret
- Slightly conspiratorial
- Not dramatic — understated
- Think: late-night radio host, or someone speaking through a door

**Pacing:**
- Pause after key lines
- Let the visuals breathe
- "Someone is at your door." [beat] "They have something to tell you."

**Voice:**
- Could be your voice
- Could be a character (Wire? Caleb?)
- Could be text-only (no VO)

## WHERE IT WOULD APPEAR

**First Visit Only:**
- After clicking "Enter" on the heraldic page
- Before showing the character gallery
- "Skip" button available
- Stores flag in localStorage so it doesn't repeat

**Optional:**
- "How to Play" button in About modal that replays it
