> Approximately 45-60 seconds.

## Script (v2)

```
Someone is at your door.

You see them through the door viewer.

They have something to tell you.

Whether you believe them is up to you.

This is THE KNOCK.

A HEARSAY experience.

You are in Room 412.

You cannot remember how you got here.

People keep coming to your door.

Click a face to invite them to speak.

They approach and step into view.

You talk face to face through the door viewer.

What they tell you may or may not be true.

That is the thing about hearsay.

When you are done for the night, end your session.

Your conversations become a chapter.

Your chapter becomes part of a story.

Someone is knocking.

Will you answer?

[pause]

We hope you will stay with us.
```

## Notes

### Tone
- Measured, slightly ominous
- Not rushed
- Let each line breathe

### Key Narrative Elements Introduced
1. **The door viewer conceit** — face-to-face, visual experience
2. **Room 412** — you're stuck here
3. **Amnesia** — you don't know how you got here
4. **Unreliability** — "may or may not be true" / hearsay theme
5. **Writing Engine** — conversations become chapters become story
6. **The tagline** — "We hope you will stay with us" (double meaning: stay at hotel / keep playing / survive)

### Visual Suggestions
- Start with peephole POV, someone approaching
- Cut to character faces as "click a face" is said
- Show the brass peephole frame
- End on the rotating hotel sign ("Stay With Us")

### ElevenLabs Notes
If using ElevenLabs for narration:
- Use `<break time="0.5s"/>` between lines
- Consider `<prosody rate="slow">` for emphasis lines
- End pause before "We hope you will stay with us" should be longer

## Future Mechanic: Unbidden Knocks

Script doesn't mention this yet, but future versions could add:

```
Most guests you summon.

But sometimes...

Someone knocks on their own.
```

This sets up the unbidden character mechanic where certain characters (Ghost of Vance, etc.) appear without being invited.

## Version History

- **v1:** "You can hear them and they can hear you" — sounded audio-only
- **v2 (current):** "You talk face to face through the door viewer" — captures visual nature
