# HEARSAY: Conversational Fiction Platform

## One-Paragraph Summary

HEARSAY is a platform for conversational narrative experiences delivered through AI talking heads. Users speak directly with characters who remember, contradict, confide, and lie. There are no puzzles to solve, no correct answers, no win states. The user is not a player—they are a witness, an editor, an interpreter. Each conversation becomes source material for a personalized literary artifact: a narrativized account of what was said, what was implied, and what might have happened in the spaces between. The first experience, **THE KNOCK**, places users in a residential hotel where they receive visitors through a door peephole—a brass circle of paranoid intimacy where everyone has a story and no two stories agree.

## Extended Description

### The Problem We're Addressing

Interactive narrative has been stuck in two modes: branching stories (choose your path) and puzzle games (solve to progress). Both treat story as something the user *navigates* rather than something they *construct*. Meanwhile, AI conversation tools remain utilitarian—chatbots, assistants, companions—divorced from the literary and theatrical traditions that have always made conversation meaningful.

### Our Approach

HEARSAY treats conversation as the primary medium of fiction. Users don't read or watch—they speak and listen. They ask questions and receive answers that may or may not be true. They build relationships with characters who have agendas, histories, and secrets they may never fully reveal.

The platform combines:
- **AI talking heads** (via Simli) that speak, react, and remember
- **Literary character design** with voices drawn from specific authors, idioms, and speech patterns
- **Unreliable narration** as a core mechanic—characters contradict each other by design
- **Physical sensory extensions** (scent, taste, touch) that make the fiction tangible
- **Automated literary transformation** that converts conversation transcripts into narrativized prose

### The First Experience: THE KNOCK

The user is a guest at a residential hotel. The owner died six months ago under unclear circumstances. The estate is in probate. People keep knocking on your door—staff, other guests, people who want something or want to tell you something. You talk to them through the peephole. You decide what to believe.

The visual conceit: POV through a brass hotel door peephole. Fisheye barrel distortion. Circular frame, heavy vignette. The user is inside, in darkness. The visitor is outside, in the hallway, face warped by the lens. Paranoid intimacy. The feeling of 2am, uncertain whether to open.

**Ten characters** with interconnected stories, contradictory accounts, and secrets that implicate each other. The user assembles meaning from fragments. There is no solution—only interpretation.

## Visual and Tonal References

The aesthetic draws from:
- **Tony Duquette** — maximalist theatrical fantasy, gilded decay, rooms as stages
- **Jan Švankmajer** — tactile surrealism, objects with memory, uncanny textures
- **Thom Browne Fall 2012** — theatrical tailoring, anachronistic formality
- **Delicatessen (Jeunet)** — sepia warmth, eccentric vertical communities
- **Tom Waits** — gravelly romanticism, carnival after closing time
- **Hermanos Gutiérrez** — cinematic Americana, dusty grandeur

The hotel exists slightly outside normal time. Everything is slightly too ornate, slightly too worn, slightly too alive.

## Technical Innovation

### Conversation as Literature
Unlike chatbots or AI companions, HEARSAY characters are designed as literary constructs. Each character prompt references specific authors, speech patterns, regional idioms, and idiosyncratic verbal tics. Wire speaks like a Richard Brautigan narrator who grew up in Rotorua. Marisol speaks like a Patricia Highsmith character who wandered into a Tom Waits song. The AI is not simulating general intelligence—it is performing a voice.

### The Writing Engine
Conversation transcripts are captured and transformed into narrativized prose by a second AI system. This is not summarization—it is literary transformation. Dialog becomes scene. Pauses become subtext. The user receives a personalized chapter of a novel that only they could have written, by having the conversations only they had.

### Sensory Extension
Optional physical packs extend the fiction into the real world: scent vials (the lobby after hours, a room closed too long), unusual candies (violet pastilles, horehound drops), paper ephemera (matchbooks, handwritten notes), small objects (a key, a button, a swatch of fabric). The user holds evidence. Smells the place. Fiction gains weight.

## What This Is Not

- **Not a murder mystery.** The user is not identifying a killer.
- **Not an escape room.** Nothing to solve, no code to crack.
- **Not a branching narrative.** The user does not choose paths—they converse.
- **Not a game.** No score, no optimization, no win state.

This is closer to reading a novel made of oral histories, except the user decides which chapters to read, in what order, and when to stop. The meaning is not hidden. It is constructed, by the user, from what they heard.

## Platform Potential

HEARSAY is designed as a platform, not a single experience. Different "volumes" use different visual conceits:

| Experience | Visual Frame | Premise |
|------------|--------------|---------|
| **The Knock** | Peephole, fisheye, brass ring | Hotel, owner's death, unreliable witnesses |
| The Portrait Gallery | Gilt frames, faces animate within paintings | Art collection, provenance disputes |
| The Waiting Room | Intake window, plexiglass | Bureaucratic limbo, no one remembers how long |
| The Séance | Dark mirror, scrying screen | Gathering testimony from the dead |
| The Confessional | Lattice screen, partial obscurity | Anonymous confidences, overlapping sins |

The technology is the same. The feeling is different.

## Why This Matters

We are in a moment when AI threatens to flatten language into slop—generic, safe, on-distribution. HEARSAY demonstrates the opposite possibility: AI as a medium for literary voice, for unreliable narration, for the kind of specificity that makes fiction feel alive.

Conversation has always been how humans construct reality together. HEARSAY makes that construction visible, playable, and personal.

*What you hear depends on who you ask.*
*What you believe is up to you.*
