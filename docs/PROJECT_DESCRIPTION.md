# HEARSAY

**A conversational fiction platform**

---

## Project Statement

HEARSAY is an interactive narrative platform that uses real-time AI conversation as its primary medium. Users speak directly with fictional characters through voice—characters who listen, respond, remember, and sometimes lie. The experience sits at the intersection of literature, theatre, game design, and conversational AI, creating a form of fiction that can only exist through dialogue.

Unlike choose-your-own-adventure structures or puzzle-based interactive fiction, HEARSAY offers no correct paths, no solutions, no win states. Users construct meaning through conversation itself: by deciding which questions to ask, which answers to believe, and which contradictions to pursue. The result is a deeply personal engagement with narrative—one where interpretation replaces progression and listening replaces solving.

## The First Experience: THE KNOCK

The debut experience places users in a residential hotel. The owner died six months ago under unclear circumstances. Through a door peephole—a circular frame of paranoid intimacy—users receive visitors: staff members, long-term guests, people with information and agendas. Each character offers a version of events. No two versions agree.

Ten fully-realized characters populate the hotel, each with:
- Distinct voice, vocabulary, and speech patterns
- Personal history and hidden motivations  
- Relationships and conflicts with other characters
- Secrets they protect and information they trade

The visual presentation uses fisheye distortion to simulate the peephole perspective, creating an atmosphere of surveillance, uncertainty, and threshold—the feeling of 2am, uncertain whether to open the door.

## Technical Architecture

The platform integrates multiple AI and media systems:

**Conversational AI Layer**
- Real-time voice-to-voice interaction via Simli SDK
- Custom character prompts with literary voice design
- Session state management and conversation memory

**Visual Composition System**
- Multi-layer video compositing with dynamic transparency
- Transition animations between character states
- Canvas-based real-time video processing

**Narrative Generation Pipeline**
- Automated transcript capture from each session
- AI-powered transformation of dialogue into narrativized prose
- Personal literary artifacts generated from user conversations

**Sensory Extension System**
- Physical object packs that extend fiction into material form
- Scent, taste, and tactile elements keyed to characters
- Ephemera design (matchbooks, handwritten notes, photographs)

The complete system comprises approximately 15,000 lines of custom code across frontend application, backend services, state management, AI integration, and documentation—built without frameworks to maintain precise control over the experience.

## Position in the Field

HEARSAY occupies a distinctive position among several adjacent fields:

**As Literature:** Characters are designed with the specificity of literary fiction—idiosyncratic voices, unreliable narration, meaning constructed through what is said and unsaid. The writing engine transforms conversation into prose, producing personalized literary artifacts.

**As Theatre:** Each encounter is a performance. Characters respond in the moment. The user is both audience and interlocutor—the conversation cannot happen without them, and it will never happen exactly the same way twice.

**As Game:** The experience has mechanics (whom to summon, what to ask, when to dismiss) without having objectives. It rewards curiosity and attention rather than optimization. It is playable without being winnable.

**As Art Installation:** The sensory packs, the visual treatment, and the peephole frame create an aesthetic environment. Future iterations may include physical installation, site-specific presentation, or gallery exhibition.

**As Research:** The project investigates AI as a medium for literary voice rather than general intelligence; conversation as a form of meaning-making; and the possibilities for personalized narrative generation at the intersection of user participation and automated authorship.

## Current Status

**Completed:**
- Functional web application deployed and publicly accessible
- Three characters fully integrated with voice AI
- Seven additional characters designed and documented
- Sensory pack contents and descriptions for all characters
- Bar menu with character-specific cocktails and stories
- Transcript capture and storage pipeline
- Complete technical and creative documentation

**In Development:**
- Remaining character voice integration
- Narrative generation engine (transcript → prose)
- Physical sensory pack production
- Additional visual polish and performance optimization

**Seeking:**
- Production funding for completion and expansion
- Festival, gallery, or venue presentation opportunities
- Publishing partnerships for physical and literary components
- Research collaboration on conversational narrative and AI authorship

## Summary

HEARSAY demonstrates that AI conversation can be a literary medium—specific, authored, unreliable in productive ways. It treats dialogue not as interface but as fiction, and users not as players but as interpreters. The platform creates space for a kind of storytelling that requires speaking and listening, where meaning emerges from the accumulation of partial truths and the silences between them.
