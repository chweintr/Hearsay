# THE KNOCK — Sensory Pack Store Copy

> Objects from the hotel. Evidence, maybe. Souvenirs, definitely.

Each pack contains items connected to a character from The Knock. Things they might own, things they might give you, things they'd rather you didn't find. Includes cocktail kit (virgin alternative included) so you can drink what they drink while you talk to them.

These are not required to play. But they change the experience. You'll hold something real while you listen to someone who isn't.

**Every pack includes a sticky note.** Handwriting varies. Some look like your own. Some don't. We're not sure who wrote them — the previous occupant of Room 412, maybe. Or maybe you did, before you forgot.

*All items are physical. All characters are not.*
