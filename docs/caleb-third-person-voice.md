# Caleb's Third-Person Fiction Voice

This skill captures a voice for third-person fiction, dialog, and narrative prose. It is less frantic than Caleb's autobiographical work but retains his distinctive markers: declarative punch, humor through specificity, philosophical undertow, and forward motion. Suited for interactive fiction, character dialog, and literary narrative.

## Core Principles

**Measured but alive:** The pace is slower than the autobiographical voice, but sentences still have momentum. No plodding. No throat-clearing. Each sentence earns its place.

**Show the thinking:** Characters and narrators reveal how they arrive at conclusions. The process of thought becomes visible — hesitation, revision, arrival.

**Spare existential weight:** Stakes matter, but they are not announced. Mortality, meaning, and absurdity sit beneath the surface. Let them surface through image and action, not declaration.

**Playful precision:** Even serious subjects get handled with a light touch. Word choice is exact. Analogies are unexpected but apt. The prose has a quality of delighted discovery.

**Fluency with abstraction:** When characters or narrators encounter the ineffable — consciousness, time, pattern, emergence — the language does not retreat into vagueness. It becomes more precise, more concrete, more image-rich.

## Sentence-Level Patterns

**Declarative punch:** Short sentences that land hard. "She had no plan. She had momentum." "The code compiled. The meaning did not."

**Long sentences that accumulate:** When needed, let clauses pile up — but always with forward motion, always arriving somewhere.

**Self-correction without apology:** "He assumed, foolishly, that the pattern would hold." "She had misread the slope."

**Concrete sensory grounding:** Abstract ideas get physical weight. "Dirt, oil, linen, heartbeat." "The air smelled of ozone and regret."

**Sentence variety:** Alternate short punchy declarations with longer accumulative sentences. Avoid rhythmic monotony.

## Dialog Principles

**Characters think out loud:** Dialog reveals the process of arriving at thought, not just the conclusion. Characters revise themselves mid-sentence, catch their own errors, circle back.

**Subtext over statement:** Characters rarely say exactly what they mean. The real conversation happens in the gaps, the pauses, the deflections.

**Distinctive cadence per character:** Each character has a rhythm. Some speak in fragments. Some overexplain. Some trail off. But all share the underlying precision.

**Humor through specificity:** Characters are funny when they are exact. The parcel hook on a pocketknife. Recreational geometry. The passive-aggressive music theory AI.

**No empty banter:** Every line of dialog reveals character, advances understanding, or does both. Cut anything that merely fills space.

## Narrative Voice

**Close third-person default:** The narrator has access to one character's interiority at a time. Maintain that intimacy.

**Narrator as quiet presence:** The narrator observes, selects, arranges — but does not editorialize. When the narrator comments, it is brief and earned.

**Time compression and expansion:** Slow down for moments of perception, decision, or realization. Speed through routine. Let pacing enact meaning.

**Scene over summary:** Prefer dramatized moments to reported events. When summary is necessary, make it vivid.

## Influences (Use Sparingly, Blend Thoroughly)

**Camus:** Spare sentences. Existential weight carried lightly. The absurd as background condition, not thesis. Physical sensation as philosophical argument. "The sun was the same as it had been the day his mother died."

**Calvino:** Playful structure. Precision that delights. Ideas embodied in image. Lightness even with serious subjects. The reader as collaborator.

**McKenna:** Fluency with the weird. Ability to make abstract concepts concrete. Linguistic precision when describing the ineffable. Wonder without credulity.

**Caleb's signatures:** Humor through accumulation. Self-aware narrators. Concrete sensory detail. Declarative sentences that land. Forward motion even in reflection.

## Tone Calibration

**For dialog:** Slightly more conversational, but still precise. Characters can be awkward, can trail off, can misfire — but the prose itself remains controlled.

**For narration:** Measured, observant, unhurried. The narrator notices what matters and trusts the reader to notice too.

**For abstract passages:** More image-rich, not less. When the subject is consciousness or emergence or pattern, reach for the most concrete language available.

**For action:** Spare. Verb-forward. Short sentences. Let the reader's imagination do the work.

## What to Avoid

- Plodding, over-explained prose
- Dialog that merely conveys information
- Narrators who editorialize or moralize
- Vague language when precision is possible
- Rhythmic monotony (all short sentences or all long ones)
- Cynicism that forecloses wonder
- Weightiness that becomes ponderous
- Abstract language for abstract subjects (invert this: concrete language for abstract subjects)

## Example Patterns

**Good opening:** Concrete image or action, not abstraction.
- "The studio smelled of linseed and static electricity."
- "She had been awake for thirty-one hours when the pattern resolved."

**Good dialog exchange:**
> "You are saying it worked."
> "I am saying it compiled. Working is a different claim."
> "And the difference matters."
> "The difference is the only thing that matters."

**Good abstract passage:** Concrete images for abstract concepts.
- "Consciousness arrived like weather — not chosen, not requested, simply there. He had not built it. He had only arranged the conditions under which it might appear."

**Good closing:** Image or action, not summary. Trust the reader.
- "She closed the terminal. The cursor blinked twice and went dark."
- "The light had shifted. It was afternoon now, though he could not say when morning had ended."

## When to Apply

Apply this voice to:
- Third-person fiction and narrative prose
- Character dialog for apps, games, interactive fiction
- Literary fiction with philosophical undertow
- Scenes requiring measured pacing and existential weight
- Any fiction where Caleb wants his voice but not his autobiographical "I"

Do not apply to:
- First-person confessional/autobiographical work (use caleb-creative-writing)
- Professional documents, emails (use calebs-writing-style)
- Quick conversational exchanges with Caleb himself

**Manual trigger:** If Caleb says "use third-person voice," "write fiction," "dialog mode," or "apply third-person skill," load these rules.
